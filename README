Overview:
 - Records and playbacks QEvents in any dynamically-linked Qt application
 - Useful for testing
 - Useful for macros
 - Useful for pseudo-screencasts (in a significantly bandwidth-reduced form)

Directories:
 - demo: Simple Qt application for testing/demo purposes
 - hook: the logger/"spy" (requires injection)
 - hooq: CLI application for testing
 - hooqInjector: library for injecting the libraries
 - lib: classes used in all the other libraries/applications except 'demo'
 - player: the playback library (requires injection)

Method:
 - The logger/player libraries are injected into any Qt application's process
 - The logger receives all QEvents via QInternal::registerCallback() (sorry for QInternal)
 - The player posts events via QCoreApplication::postEvent()

Injection method:
 - Linux/OSX: gdb/gdbserver is attached to the process; then, the extra library is loaded
 	via dlopen(), and one of the functions "startHooqRecording()" or "startHooqPlayback()"
	is called, after calling "setHooqLogFile()"
 - Windows: The libraries are loaded by calling StartProcessThread, passing LoadLibrary as
 	the parameter. Unfortunately, we can't be sure of the address our library (and functions)
	have been loaded at, so can't call them externally - instead, they've got a fixed
	configuration, and are initialised by the constructor of an object with a global static
	instance.
